Make a rake task to auto generate an .rbz for easy install  It's simple. RBZ files are nothing more than ZIP files. You can use your favorite ZIP tool (I like 7-zip on Windows) to create the archive, then rename it to have a .RBZ extension. Anything you put inside of this RBZ file, including files and subfolders, will be unpacked into the user's Plugins folder. That's it!
