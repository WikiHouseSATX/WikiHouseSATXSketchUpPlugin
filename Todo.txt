Pending Work
=====================
Focus on Nesting for Laser first
Add a label to all parts for cutting

Single Nesting
==============



First Fit Decreasing Nesting
===============
Doesn't rotate parts to fit them on to the sheet - need to learn from the single nester
should consider rotating the parts for better fit
If a part doesn't fit - it creates a new sheet. The next part should go back and see if
its on any existing sheets before creating another sheet

On nesting
    Should evaluate how well it nested based on area remaining
     machine should set the stroke probably as well
Nesting Saver
===============
SHould handle error cases (file exists, or can't be written to)
Should ask for a directory to store the files in .


better nesting idea - https://github.com/uhop/tight-sprite/blob/master/README.md

Get rendering to work - for the wall builder
  - Add support for Door Panel, Door Wall Panel, Half Height Wall Panel, New Wall Panel Column
Make it so that dimenstions of the parent pare are set by the intializer and have defautls

Add idea of sections instead of fusion (remove fusion from the Door Panel Bottom Header)
Find the places were we override right/left/face to find the pattern

Fix it so we don't have to put WikiHouse:: infront of everything.
Change out the top/bottom,left,right to north,south,east,west so orientation can handle it


When we start building the ui - store the settings they choose into the modle the way they do in the svg plugin.
Pending Parts
========================
Triangle Corner
Sliding Door Panel

Groove work -
    It doesn't handle groove fillets right
    It doesn't set the material after drawing in
    It doens't know if they are the entier length or not
    It doesn't flatanize properly
    It isn't set as an inside edge.


Build way to configure machine and choose default sheet
Build a button to center/top the view

Remove Typename clals - http://forums.sketchucation.com/viewtopic.php?f=180&t=25305
Refactor the fillet to only need a single index instead of three
Refactor the draw! method so the bookkeeping of of drawn! is handled automatically

To Replace Aspire
====================
Need to be able to nest parts
Generate Gcode
Need to be able to generate tabs for the part

Make a rake task to auto generate an .rbz for easy install  It's simple. RBZ files are nothing more than ZIP files. You can use your favorite ZIP tool (I like 7-zip on Windows) to create the archive, then rename it to have a .RBZ extension. Anything you put inside of this RBZ file, including files and subfolders, will be unpacked into the user's Plugins folder. That's it!
