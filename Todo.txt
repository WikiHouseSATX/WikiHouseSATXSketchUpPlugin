########   OpenSBP Work
# Be able to cut the outer loop of the chris desk parts
# Need to be able to handle inside profile cuts for a face
# Need to be able to handle a tool path that has inside, outside, and on profiles in the same path

# Need to be able to handle the depth of a pocket
# need to be able to handle the path on a fillet
# need to be able to work on a part hat hasn't been completely flattened.
# need to be able to cut an arc /circle
# need to be able to cut a dowel hole

#Whn I pull parts I need to be able to store which face is up for the purpose of cutting pockets
#Make a set of calibration parts to make sure that the math is all right - physical unit tests



Pull out part
Be able to mark the side red or green
LIne up dowel hole on the two parts

Take part - find all edges - take them down to z 0

Chris Desk
==============
Need to

Convert the slots into 3/4 & 1/2 t pockets
Be able to scale it down to laser size
Add slots to the top



Need to be able ot make dowel hole that diameter 1/4" and 0.625" deep
4 inches apart on the center line -staggered
Flatten them with all edges intact

#look at how to do a nested context menu


Pending Work
=====================
Need to fix Helpers so they work like concerns so you can nest the include
Focus on Nesting for Laser first
Add a label to all parts for cutting

BUG  - the layers aren't correct for the nesting
Need to track inside/outside edges in the nested sheets as well
Part labeling is being done
Aspire needs the sheets to be stacked on individual layers at 0,0 for export

First Fit Decreasing Nesting
===============
Doesn't rotate parts to fit them on to the sheet - need to learn from the single nester
should consider rotating the parts for better fit
If a part doesn't fit - it creates a new sheet. The next part should go back and see if
its on any existing sheets before creating another sheet

On nesting
    Should evaluate how well it nested based on area remaining
     machine should set the stroke probably as well
Nesting Saver
===============
SHould handle error cases (file exists, or can't be written to)
Should ask for a directory to store the files in .

The tool should control what happens when you save- SVG for laser - SBP for CNC


Aspire Removal
=========
Generate OpenSBP
Generate tabs for a part - generate a tab that is length and thickness - distance between tabs. Don't like corners


better nesting idea - https://github.com/uhop/tight-sprite/blob/master/README.md

Handle DXF/ShopBot Nesting Output
Get rendering to work - for the wall builder
  - Add support for Door Panel, Door Wall Panel, Half Height Wall Panel, New Wall Panel Column
Make it so that dimenstions of the parent pare are set by the intializer and have defautls

Add idea of sections instead of fusion (remove fusion from the Door Panel Bottom Header)
Find the places were we override right/left/face to find the pattern

Fix it so we don't have to put WikiHouse:: infront of everything.
Change out the top/bottom,left,right to north,south,east,west so orientation can handle it


Cutting
=========
You want to cut all grooves and pockets before outlines
Tool pass depth is set by chip load - based on the tool chosen
Tools
    Name
    Diameter
    cutting parameters - pass depth, step over (if you are doing a side by side pass how much you move it over to
    cut it again for a pocket)

    Onsurb 60-111 1/4" Compression Spiral
    diamter .25
    pass depth .25
    step over .125
    spindle speed 13000
    feed rate 3.0 inches per second
    plunge rate - 1 in per second
    tool number 11

When we start building the ui - store the settings they choose into the modle the way they do in the svg plugin.
Pending Parts
========================
Triangle Corner
Sliding Door Panel
Roof
Torsion Floor

Groove work -
    It doesn't handle groove fillets right
    It doesn't set the material after drawing in
    It doens't know if they are the entier length or not
    It doesn't flatanize properly
    It isn't set as an inside edge.


Build way to configure machine and choose default sheet
Build a button to center/top the view

Remove Typename clals - http://forums.sketchucation.com/viewtopic.php?f=180&t=25305
Refactor the fillet to only need a single index instead of three
Refactor the draw! method so the bookkeeping of of drawn! is handled automatically

To Replace Aspire
====================
Need to be able to nest parts
Generate Gcode
Need to be able to generate tabs for the part

Make a rake task to auto generate an .rbz for easy install  It's simple. RBZ files are nothing more than ZIP files. You can use your favorite ZIP tool (I like 7-zip on Windows) to create the archive, then rename it to have a .RBZ extension. Anything you put inside of this RBZ file, including files and subfolders, will be unpacked into the user's Plugins folder. That's it!
